== Description ==
Important: To make it work with Wordpress 3.01, you will have to make sure that permalinks is set to default.

LiveGrounds is a plugin for WordPress blogs, where the blogger and her/his readers can interact live via a state-of-the-art graphical user interface. For the blogger, LiveGrounds is an easily moderated community based on the blog. For the reader, LiveGrounds allows for instant communication with people who share the same interests, without having to log in or download any extra program. 

People visiting your blog will recognize you (your avatar) as the blog owner if you first register as a user and then associate your email with your blog in the Settings section of WP-admin. For more information about this, see FAQ. 

= Known issues =

* LiveGrounds might not be compatible with other plugins that you have installed
* The graphical user interface of LiveGrounds can in certain cases be impacted by your blog's theme
* You need a modern browser that accepts third party cookies to use LiveGrounds

Read the last paragraph in the FAQ to see how you can set yourself up as a blog owner and thereby get access to a log of the public messages on your blog, as well as a differently colored figure that distinguishes you from your visitors.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I launch LiveGrounds? =

To launch LiveGrounds and meet all of the people currently visiting the blog, click on the rectangle visible in the bottom right corner. If you have closed down this rectangle to hide the LiveGrounds plugin or if it has disappeared due to inactivity, just reload the page (in certain browsers you have to clear the cache as well).

= Who are the people on the ground? =

You are the red avatar (the LiveGrounds term is "gubbe"), other people are black. If you see a blue avatar on the ground, it's the blog owner. A grey avatar represents a person who is not currently looking at the blog. After 1 hour of inactivity your avatar will automatically disappear from the ground. If you close the browser window you will disappear from the ground after 1 minute. You can drag & drop yourself and the pop-up windows. 

= How do I change my name? =

By default your name will be the country from which you are surfing followed by a number. You can change your name by clicking on it and writing another name that is not already taken. In some browsers you may have to reload the page before any changes take effect.

= How do I communicate? =

Click on yourself to say something publicly to everyone on the ground. Note that the blog owner can see a log of all public messages. Click on someone else to start a private conversation that no one else can see, not even the blog owner. While chatting privately you can invite other people into the conversation by clicking Group Chat. If you click "More" in another person's profile/chat window you will be able to "Block user", which makes you invisible (until you Unblock that person).


= How do I create a profile? =

If you visit a blog regularly you may want to create a permanent profile. Click on yourself, then Edit Profile, fill in any information you like and then click Get a Login. User names need to be unique, not only to one particular blog but to all other people with logins at LiveGrounds. The name sign over your avatar will change appearance once you've logged in.

= How do I register as a blog owner? =

Registering as a blog owner is optional. It makes it easier for your visitors to recognize you and it gives you access to a log of public messages.

1. Get a login on the ground like a regular user.
2. Go to the Settings section for the LiveGrounds plugin in WP-admin and input the same login details you used in step 1.
